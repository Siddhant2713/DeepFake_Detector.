# 🔬 DeepForged Forensics
## Temporal Localization Engine v2.0

**A professional-grade, open-source forensic analysis tool for journalists, fact-checkers, and investigators.**

### What This Tool Does
Detects temporal manipulation and artifacts in video and image evidence through:
- Frame-level temporal inconsistency analysis
- Compression pattern detection
- Metadata forensics
- Visual artifact identification

### What This Tool Doesn't Do
- ❌ Provide instant results (analysis takes 3-15 minutes)
- ❌ Guarantee 100% accuracy (all results are probabilistic)
- ❌ Replace human verification (tool assists, doesn't replace expertise)

### Methodology
Open-source algorithms with transparent confidence scoring.
No black boxes. No hype. Just evidence.

**⚠️ Important:** This tool requires time for thorough analysis. Results are likelihood assessments, not absolute verdicts.
